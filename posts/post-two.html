                            If you don’t know who’s visiting your website, your strategy has a few issues we need to address. First off, if you don’t know who’s coming to your website, why do you even have one? Joker Media uses Google Analytics for clients to see you is visiting when and from where. Once you know who your audience is, you can adjust your content to reach out to the clients you truly intend to. We can help you strategize and reach the right people. It can be done with a redesigned website, or an update to your current one

                            Whether you have the latest bells and whistles or not, examining the user journey on your website determines your success for CRO. Does your website clearly guide users to your ultimate goal? Call to action links should be clear, leading visitors to the next step. Imagery, headlines, copy should all inform and guide users. Too many steps on the path to purchase, including having too many form fields, can decrease user engagement and cause drop-off before conversions. Reducing these potential blocks and making things as easy as possible has the potential to increase conversion rate. It’s important to test out the user journey on your website and find the decision points, copy, or call to actions that are leading to failed conversions.

                            Though it’s great if your site looks polished and modern, an attractive appearance means nothing if it’s not showing up in search results. If your site isn’t ranking well, it’s not doing one of its most important jobs. Though there are a number of things that go into ranking at the top of Google, your website’s usability plays a big role in what Google constitutes as a helpful, reliable site.

                            If anything on this list can be said of your website, it might be time to consider a new one. If you are embarrassed by your website and avoid telling your clients about it, then it should be out with old and in with the new. Your company website should be something you and your employees are proud of. It should represent your company well and contain compelling content to attract prospects, convert leads and engage customers. Need help figuring it all out? We’re here to help.

                            Plain and simple, if you aren’t getting enough leads or conversions from your site, it’s likely time for an upgrade. All the reasons we’ve outlined on this list can contribute to poor conversion rates and, if more than one problem looks familiar, you owe it to yourself and your bottom line to update your business website.
